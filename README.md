Repository for Udacity CS373: [Artifical Intelligence for Robotics](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373) lectured by Sebastian Thrun

The course is separated into 6 section with one final project, all the programming asiignment are written in `python`

### Course topic included:
- Localization
- Kalman Filter
- Particle Filter
- Path planning 
- PID control
- SLAM

### Extra Info
- For each topic, I put some related resources I found on the Internet in every `lesson_note` markdown file
- Also, I implemented some visualization for the algorithms learned from this course with ROS rviz, which is located in this [repo](https://github.com/ShinYuFish/cs373_visualization)
